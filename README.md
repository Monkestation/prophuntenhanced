## Information

## Main gamemode Description
Prop Hunt: Enhanced is an improved version of the classic Prop Hunt Gamemode. This gamemode is focused on continuous maintenance and full customisation, offering numerous features. It includes significant changes such as an enhanced HUD, code optimisation, player skins, and additional features.

This gamemode was contributed to the original Prop Hunt as a fix for the March 2015 update (which completely broke the original version) and includes viewmodel fix additions. The classic version may no longer be maintained.
