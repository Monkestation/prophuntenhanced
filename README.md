## Information

## Main gamemode Description
Prop Hunt: Enhanced is an improved version of the classic Prop Hunt Gamemode. This gamemode is focused on continuous maintenance and full customisation, offering numerous features. It includes significant changes such as an enhanced HUD, code optimisation, player skins, and additional features.

This gamemode was contributed to the original Prop Hunt as a fix for the March 2015 update (which completely broke the original version) and includes viewmodel fix additions. The classic version may no longer be maintained.

## NEW Features (15-12-2024)
This version adds a few new features:
* New Default TAB Menu (No more crappy Default Fretta Menu)
* An improved team balancing system, which now uses more sensible defaults, and allows using a personalised amount of Hunters
* Automatic team shuffling, so people no longer have to manually pick a team
* An option to prevent being a Hunter twice in a row, as well as a way to force someone to be a Prop during the next round, in case the shuffling is a bit too random for you :)
* An option to use rotating roles, so that everyone plays each role the same number of times
* A configurable unstucking system: getting stuck in a wall is no longer a death sentence (F3 or !unstuck)
* Taunts can now be pitched up or down, as much as the server admin allows it!
* An experimental, more lenient collision system, which solves some props being unable to touch walls, but introduces some clipping (disabled by default)
* And many other enhancements and fixes!
